# xyOps™

> Your job scheduler should know what your servers are doing.

**xyOps is the next generation of Cronicle:** a complete, self-hosted platform for job scheduling, visual workflow automation, server monitoring, alerting, and incident response.

[![xyOps workflow editor](https://pixlcore.com/images/blog/xyops/workflow-edit.webp)](https://xyops.io/)

**Fully open source. Self-hosted. No telemetry. No feature gates.**

xyOps connects the work you run with the systems it runs on. Schedule jobs across a fleet, build visual workflows, watch jobs and infrastructure together, capture the exact state of a server when an alert fires, and respond without reconstructing the incident across five different tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every xyOps application feature is free and open source, including [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.xyops.io/sso).** SSO, OIDC integration, group-to-role mapping, multi-conductor scaling, air-gapped operation, workflows, monitoring, alerting, and ticketing are not paid features. Professional and Enterprise plans purchase human support, faster response targets, and hands-on assistance. They do not unlock software.

## Why xyOps

- **Schedule and run anything:** Launch scripts and plugins on one server, a server group, or your entire fleet. Use recurring schedules, cron expressions, intervals, webhooks, priorities, queues, and resource limits.
- **Orchestrate visually:** Build understandable workflows with branching, parallel execution, joins, human approval, reusable sub-workflows, replay, and data passing.
- **Observe the real system:** Monitor jobs and servers together with live dashboards, custom metrics, process inspection, network connections, and historical performance.
- **Respond with context:** Turn failures and alerts into actions. Capture server snapshots, open tickets, call webhooks, block unsafe launches, or start remediation automatically.

### From alert to root cause in two clicks

When an alert fires, xyOps can freeze the relevant server state at that moment: metrics, processes, network connections, active jobs, and alert data. Open the alert, then open its snapshot. The evidence is already waiting for you.

## Cronicle evolved

xyOps is built by the creator of [Cronicle](https://github.com/jhuckaby/Cronicle) and carries its job-scheduling and plugin philosophy forward into a new architecture.

Existing Cronicle users can:

- Import Cronicle data through the xyOps interface.
- Keep compatible plugins and familiar scheduling concepts.
- Convert multiplexed events into visual workflows.
- Run jobs through lightweight xySat workers with no Node.js requirement.
- Enable Cronicle compatibility mode and optionally restore Cronicle branding.

## Try xyOps in one command

If you have Docker, this starts a disposable xyOps conductor with a local worker so you can explore the complete product immediately:

```bash
docker run --detach --rm --init \
	--name xyops-try \
	--hostname xyops-try \
	-e XYOPS_masters="xyops-try" \
	-e XYOPS_xysat_local="true" \
	-e XYOPS_base_app_url="http://localhost:5522" \
	-e TZ="America/Los_Angeles" \
	-p 5522:5522 \
	ghcr.io/pixlcore/xyops:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:5522/](http://localhost:5522/) and sign in with:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

This trial is intentionally disposable. Stop it with `docker stop xyops-try`, and Docker will remove the container and its data. Change `TZ` if you want the trial to use a different timezone.

For a persistent or production deployment, continue with the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://docs.xyops.io/hosting).

## Open source without feature gates

The complete xyOps application is available under the [BSD 3-Clause license](LICENSE.md). There is no separate commercial build and no vendor cloud control plane required to operate it.

Your jobs, logs, metrics, secrets, files, tickets, snapshots, and configuration remain inside your infrastructure. xyOps does not send product telemetry to PixlCore or to any other telemetry service.

## Development

See the [Development Guide](https://docs.xyops.io/dev) for complete local setup instructions. In short, install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops.git
cd xyops
npm install
node bin/build.js dev
echo '{ "secret_key": "test" }' > conf/overrides.json
bin/debug.sh
```

# Recipes

## Overview

This document provides a set of useful recipes you can use in xyOps.

## Continuous Jobs

A continuous job is defined as a job that automatically relaunches itself upon completion. This functionality can enhance the efficiency and reliability of job execution in various systems.

### Implementing Continuous Jobs

To implement a continuous job, follow these steps:

1. **Wire Up Completion Actions**: 
   - Set up actions that will trigger the same event upon job completion.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - If the job fails, implement a separate error handler. This handler can:
     - Notify the responsible parties about the failure.
     - Restart the job if necessary.

### Managing Job Failures

For jobs that experience repeated failures, it is essential to manage the process to prevent system disruption. Consider the following strategies:

- **Retry Limiter**: 
  - Establish a maximum limit for retries to avoid indefinite job execution.
- **Retry Delay**: 
  - Introduce a delay between retries to allow for recovery or resolution of the underlying issue.

### Summary

By following these guidelines, you can create a robust continuous job system that can efficiently manage execution, handle errors gracefully, and avoid negative impacts on system performance. 

## Nightly S3 Backup Workflow

Back up databases and files to Amazon S3 on a fixed schedule, with optional retention and notifications.

### How It Works

- Trigger: Add a `schedule` trigger for 01:00 in your timezone, and enable `catchup` so missed runs replay after outages.
- Workflow: Use a workflow so you can multiplex the job across multiple DB servers.
  - Multiplex Controller: Attach a job node to run on a group of servers (i.e. "Database" group).
    - Use the "stagger" option to spread jobs out, or use [Max Concurrent Jobs](limits.md#max-concurrent-jobs) and [Max Queue Limit](limits.md#max-queue-limit) to run them in series.
  - Job node 1: Shell Plugin to create backups on each target DB server. 
    - Examples: `pg_dump` or `mysqldump`, plus `tar` and `gzip` for directories.
	- Add files to output of job, e.g. `echo '{"xy":1, "code":0, "files":["*.tgz"]}'`;
  - Job node 2, wired via "continue" condition: Upload all input files to S3.
    - Target a server with outbound network access.
- Limits: Add [Max Run Time](limits.md#max-run-time) and [Max CPU Limit](limits.md#max-cpu-limit) limits to the backup job. Add [Max Concurrent Jobs](limits.md#max-concurrent-jobs) limit to avoid overlapping runs.
- Notifications: Add a [Web Hook](actions.md#web-hook) or [Email](actions.md#email) action on `error` and `critical` with links to the job.

### Notes

- Use `params` and event `fields` for database credentials and include Secrets where appropriate.

## Video Transcoding Pipeline with ffmpeg

Transcode incoming videos to MP4 H.264 and push the outputs to storage and a CDN. Supports parallel processing with progress feedback.

### How It Works

- Entry: Manual trigger for ad hoc batches or a custom trigger plugin that watches an S3 bucket for new file arrivals.
- Workflow graph:
  - Fetch: Optional fetch job on start to pull source files into the job input (wire manual run to different start node).
  - Split: Use a Split controller on `files` so each sub job gets exactly one input file.
  - Job: Shell Plugin that runs `ffmpeg` with a standard preset, writes output to the job temp dir, and prints periodic progress. 
    - For example, wrap ffmpeg and emit `{ "xy": 1, "progress": N }` updates while parsing ffmpeg stderr.
	- - Add files to output of job, e.g. `{"xy":1, "code":0, "files":["*.mp4"]}`;
  - Continue: After all items complete, continue to a packaging step that generates a manifest or index.
  - Store: On the transcoding node, attach a custom action to upload the MP4 outputs to S3 or other storage.
- Limits: Attach [Max CPU Limit](limits.md#max-cpu-limit), [Max Memory Limit](limits.md#max-memory-limit), [Max Run Time](limits.md#max-run-time), [Max Concurrent Jobs](limits.md#max-concurrent-jobs) and [Max Queue Limit](limits.md#max-queue-limit) limits to the transcode node to control resource usage and queue depth.
- Notifications: On `success`, fire a Web Hook to your CDN cache purge endpoint. On `error`, send email or post to a channel.

### Notes

- If you need per server fan out, target the ffmpeg at a server group instead of a single server, and select "Round Robin" algo.
- Tag successful jobs with `transcoded` and wire a `tag:transcoded` action to trigger downstream publishing.

## PostgreSQL Metrics via a Monitor Plugin

Collect PostgreSQL health metrics from the CLI and graph them, with alerts and automated remediation.

### How It Works

- Monitor Plugin: Write a simple Monitor Plugin that runs `psql` and emits one numeric metric per minute. Point the monitor expression at the plugin output.
- Examples of CLI queries that return a single number:

```sh
# Active connections on a specific database
psql -At -d mydb -c "select count(*) from pg_stat_activity where datname = 'mydb' and state = 'active'"

# Replication lag in seconds on a standby
psql -At -d postgres -c "select extract(epoch from now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp())::int"

# Autovacuum backlog estimate (dead tuples)
psql -At -d mydb -c "select n_dead_tup from pg_stat_user_tables order by n_dead_tup desc limit 1"
```

- In the monitor configuration:
  - Expression: reference the plugin command output path such as `commands.pg_active_conns`.
  - Data Match: if your plugin returns a line of text, set a regex like `(\d+)` to extract the number.
  - Type: choose `integer` or `seconds` depending on the metric.
- Alerts: Create alerts that fire when thresholds are exceeded for a few minutes, for example:
  - Active connections above 90 percent of `max_connections` for 5 minutes.
  - Replication lag above 60 seconds for 3 minutes.
- Actions: On alert, run an event that captures pg diagnostics, or kick off `vacuumdb` during a maintenance window.

### Notes

- Store database credentials in Secrets and inject via environment or params; do not hardcode.

## Sunrise and Sunset Trigger Plugin

Launch jobs at local sunrise and sunset with optional offsets. Useful for energy jobs, IoT device control, or time shifting heavy tasks to off peak windows.

### How It Works

- Trigger Plugin: Implement a scheduler plugin that calculates today's sunrise and sunset for a configured latitude and longitude. The plugin runs once per minute, compares the current time in a configured timezone, and indicates a launch when a window is hit.
  - Recommended module for Node.js: [SunCalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc)
- Parameters: `lat`, `lon`, `timezone`, `sunrise_offset_sec`, `sunset_offset_sec`, and optional `launch` selector `sunrise` or `sunset` or `both`.
- Workflow: Wire the plugin trigger node into a workflow that branches on which event fired. For example:
  - At sunrise: run an HTTP Request Plugin that calls a home automation API to power down exterior lights and open blinds.
  - At sunset: run a batch window starter that increases queue sizes or begins off peak data processing.
- Actions: Add a Web Hook on `start` and `success` for observability.
- Limits: Add `max_concurrent` to protect against duplicates if the plugin window spans multiple minutes.

### Notes

- To avoid dependency on external APIs, embed sunrise calculations in the plugin. Any language is fine.
- Provide an optional test mode that forces a launch to validate the graph end to end.

## Server Offline Notifications

Notify your team when any server disconnects from the xyOps network. This uses a [System Hook](syshooks.md), which runs in the background when matching activity is logged.

### How It Works

Add a `server_remove` hook into the [hooks](config.md#hooks) section in your `config.json`. This activity fires when a server disconnects from the network. See [Activity.action](data.md#activity-action) for the full list of hookable activity action IDs.

Simple web hook example:

```json
"hooks": {
	"server_remove": {
		"url": "https://alerts.mycompany.com/api/xyops-server-offline"
	}
}
```

Email example:

```json
"hooks": {
	"server_remove": {
		"email": "oncall-pager@mycompany.com"
	}
}
```

You can also use a configured xyOps web hook ID if you want custom headers, request body templates, or other delivery options:

```json
"hooks": {
	"server_remove": {
		"web_hook": "wmkd2yx4yw4ihh7lu"
	}
}
```

### Notes

- The `server_remove` activity fires whenever a server disconnects, including planned upgrades, service restarts, network maintenance, and other expected outages. It does not always mean the server crashed.

## Daylight Savings Time

Run a job safely during the Daylight Savings Time changeover window without duplicates or missed runs.  During DST transitions, local clocks jump between 1:00 and 3:00 AM. Two effects occur in many regions:

- Spring ahead: the clock skips from 1:59 to 3:00 AM. Any time between 2:00–2:59 AM does not exist that day.
- Fall back: the hour from 1:00–1:59 AM repeats twice. Times in that window occur twice.

Classic Unix/Linux cron uses local time and does not de-duplicate or "catch up" around DST. On spring-ahead days, a 2:30 job is skipped. On fall-back days, a 1:30 job runs twice.

### How It Works

Use the [Max Daily Limit](limits.md#max-daily-limit) feature to allow a maximum of one job completion per calendar day, then schedule two daily runs:

- Add a Max Daily Limit to the event (or workflow) with condition set to "Complete" and max daily amount set to "1". This quietly blocks any second run after one job has completed that day. See [Action.condition](data.md#action-condition) for condition meanings.
- Add two schedule triggers (or one with multiple hours selected): one at the desired time in your timezone, and a second one exactly +1 hour later.

This arrangement covers all three cases:

- **Normal days**: the job runs at the desired time; the +1 hour run is silently blocked by the daily limit.
- **Spring ahead**: the desired time may not exist (for example 2:30). The +1 hour run exists and executes; the daily limit still allows it because nothing ran yet.
- **Fall back**: the desired time occurs twice; the first occurrence runs and completes, and both the repeated occurrence and the +1 hour run are blocked by the daily limit.

Note: Manual runs skip the Max Daily Limit check, by design. If you manually re-run the job on a changeover day, it can exceed the daily count.

### Example

The following event configuration runs at 2:30 AM local time, with a safe second attempt at 3:30 AM, and allows at most one completion per day.

- **Schedule Trigger**:
	- Hours: `2` and `3` selected
	- Minutes: `30` selected
	- Timezone: Set to yours
- **Max Daily Limit**:
	- Job Condition: "Complete"
	- Max Daily Amount: 1

You can apply the same pattern to [Workflows](workflows.md) since workflows support limits as well. If you prefer to centralize the cap, you can also define this as a category limit so multiple events inherit the one-per-day rule.

# Product Comparisons

These comparisons are written for teams evaluating deployment, licensing, support, and day-to-day operational fit. xyOps prices below use month-to-month billing: **$200/month** for Professional and **$1,000/month** for Enterprise. Annual billing is also available at **$2,000/year** and **$10,000/year**, equivalent to about $167/month and $834/month.

For xyOps details, see the [pricing page](https://xyops.io/), [changelog](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), [workflow documentation](https://docs.xyops.io/workflows), [trigger documentation](https://docs.xyops.io/triggers), and [SSO documentation](https://docs.xyops.io/sso).

## n8n

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted n8n** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

The short version: n8n is a strong workflow automation product with a large integration catalog, a polished visual editor, and serious enterprise features. xyOps overlaps with n8n on workflow automation, scheduling, webhooks, plugins, secrets, users, roles, and self-hosting. But xyOps is not trying to be only an automation canvas. It is a complete operations platform that combines job scheduling, workflow orchestration, server monitoring, alerting, snapshots, ticketing, incident response, and fleet-aware execution in one self-hosted system.

The biggest licensing difference is simple: **xyOps includes all app features in the free open-source version**. Paid xyOps plans are support subscriptions. n8n's self-hosted Community Edition is free, but several collaboration, security, DevOps, observability, and scaling features require a paid plan or license key.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | n8n |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Workflow automation platform |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Fair-code / source-available model, with paid Enterprise-licensed features |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Feature licenses and support tiers |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Teams that primarily want low-code workflow automation and integration glue |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This matters for self-hosted teams because a staging lab, production cluster, air-gapped install, and internal fork can all use the same feature set.

n8n's self-hosted model is different. n8n Community Edition is free and includes the core workflow product, but the official n8n docs say Community Edition excludes the following features:

- **Custom Variables:** Reusable instance-level variables for workflows.
- **Environments:** Safer promotion between development and production setups.
- **External secrets:** Integration with external vaults such as 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, and HashiCorp Vault.
- **External storage for binary data:** Storing binary execution data outside the local/default backing store.
- **Log streaming:** Sending workflow, audit, queue, worker, and AI-node events to external logging tools.
- **Multi-main mode:** Enterprise high availability / horizontal control-plane scaling.
- **Projects:** Organizing workflows and credentials into shared team spaces.
- **SSO:** SAML and LDAP are not included in Community Edition.
- **Workflow and credential sharing:** In Community Edition, only the instance owner and creator can access workflows and credentials.
- **Version control using Git:** Git-backed promotion and change tracking for workflows.

n8n also offers a registered Community Edition license key that currently unlocks folders, debug in editor, and custom execution data. This is still free, but it requires registration with an email address and activation of a license key.

### Self-Hosted Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | n8n |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Free self-hosted** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source | Community Edition, core workflow automation, some features gated |
| **Mid-tier self-hosted** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | Business: €667/month, billed annually, 40K production workflow executions, 6 shared projects, SSO/SAML/LDAP, environments, scaling options, Git version control, forum support |
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | Enterprise Support: $1,000/month, all app features, SSO setup/support, air-gapped install support, private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat | Enterprise: contact sales, custom execution volume, unlimited shared projects, 200+ concurrent executions, longer insights retention, external secret store integration, log streaming, extended data retention, dedicated support with SLA |

There is another important self-hosting distinction: n8n Business and Enterprise features require a license key. n8n's pricing FAQ says self-hosted paid license keys must ping n8n's license server daily to stay active, and that this ping includes production execution counts. xyOps paid plans are support subscriptions and do not turn features on or off in the app.

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | n8n |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | Community forum |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | Business plan lists forum support, and n8n's pricing FAQ says dedicated support is only supported on Enterprise |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Enterprise lists dedicated support with SLA, but n8n's support scope also says guaranteed severity-level SLAs require a separate dedicated enterprise support contract |
| **Business hours** | xyOps support response times are during normal US Pacific business hours, excluding weekends and US holidays | n8n support docs define business hours as Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 17:00, with time zone based on customer region and excluding German observed holidays |

This is one of the clearer commercial differences. xyOps offers a paid Professional support plan at $200/month that includes private ticketing and a stated 24 hour turnaround. n8n's self-hosted Business plan is much more expensive, is usage-priced, and still points customers to forum support instead of dedicated support.

### Operations Coverage

| Capability | xyOps | n8n |
|------------|-------|-----|
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Yes, with a mature workflow canvas and large node catalog |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | Workflow triggers, schedules, webhooks, queues, and automation triggers |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Self-hosted scaling options and queue workers, but n8n is not centered on server-fleet targeting |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | No comparable host agent. n8n queue workers and task runners run alongside n8n or worker containers; task runners isolate Code node JavaScript/Python execution |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Execution insights and log streaming are available on paid plans, but n8n is not a server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with warm-up/cool-down samples, fire/clear actions, job limiting, and job abort controls | Error workflows, execution logging, insights, and external log streaming on paid plans |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Not a built-in incident ticketing system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Built-in encrypted credentials; external secret stores require Enterprise self-hosted or Enterprise Cloud |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | SAML and LDAP are available on Business; broader Enterprise identity options depend on the commercial license |
| **Roles and permissions** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | RBAC is available on all plans except Community Edition, with plan-specific project and role limits |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | n8n supports self-hosting, but paid feature activation depends on license-server reachability unless separately arranged |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **n8n** when the main problem is integrating SaaS apps, APIs, AI tools, and data movement in a visual workflow product, especially if the team values n8n's node ecosystem and does not need built-in fleet monitoring, alerting, snapshots, or tickets.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating infrastructure and production workflows together: scheduling jobs across servers, selecting healthy targets, seeing live metrics, firing alerts, attaching snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation jobs from the same system.

### Key Takeaways

- n8n is a strong automation tool, but its free self-hosted tier excludes several team, security, observability, and enterprise operations features.
- xyOps includes all app features in the open-source version, including SSO, roles, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, plugins, web hooks, buckets, secrets, snapshots, and fleet-aware scheduling.
- n8n Business is a paid self-hosted feature tier at €667/month, billed annually, but it still lists forum support.
- xyOps Professional is a $200/month support plan with private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround.
- xyOps Enterprise is a $1,000/month support plan with 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support.
- The products do not line up exactly. n8n is primarily workflow automation. xyOps is workflow automation plus the surrounding ops control plane.

## Rundeck

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Rundeck** and **PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Rundeck is one of the closest comparisons to xyOps because it is also designed for operations automation, scheduled jobs, self-service runbooks, and controlled execution across infrastructure. It is directly aimed at platform engineering, DevOps, SRE, and IT operations teams.

The biggest difference is packaging. Rundeck OSS provides the core open-source runbook automation product. PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted is the commercial product built on Rundeck, and it adds enterprise support, high availability, remote execution runners, SSO, advanced scheduling, advanced webhooks, workflow visualization, GUI-based ACL tooling, and other production-scale features. xyOps includes all app features in the free open-source version, and paid xyOps plans add support services only.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Rundeck |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Runbook automation and self-service operations |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes, via PagerDuty Runbook Automation SaaS |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Rundeck OSS is Apache-2.0, with commercial PagerDuty Runbook Automation products |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Commercial licenses with additional product features and support |
| **Best fit** | Teams that want automation, server monitoring, alerting, tickets, and remediation in one platform | Teams that want self-service runbooks, delegated job execution, and enterprise automation controls |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This includes workflows, scheduling, SSO, users, roles, secrets, plugins, web hooks, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, buckets, APIs, and fleet-aware execution.

Rundeck OSS includes the core product: workflow execution, community plugins, IT workflow standardization, key/password encryption, basic ops scheduling, job activity logs, and key storage. PagerDuty's comparison page lists the following as commercial features for Runbook Automation Self-Hosted and/or Runbook Automation:

- **Enterprise Support:** Priority-based support, account management, SLA response, and related commercial support features.
- **High Availability Clusters:** Multiple Rundeck instances for availability, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
- **Enterprise Runner:** Secure remote execution into private networks and remote environments without opening inbound access to the central server.
- **Failed Job Resume:** Resume a job from the failed step.
- **Node Health Checks:** Check whether nodes are ready for job execution.

- **Configuration Management:** Set configuration through the GUI and store it in the Rundeck database.
- **AI-generated Runbooks:** Generate runbooks using commercial product features.
- **ROI Plugin:** Track return-on-investment style automation metrics.
- **Job Independent Scheduling:** Manage schedules separately from job definitions.
- **Blackout Calendaring:** Define schedule blackout periods.
- **Schedule Forecast Visualization:** Preview future scheduled runs.
- **Missed Job Fires:** Record missed scheduled executions in activity history.

### Self-Hosted Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | Rundeck |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free self-hosted** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source | Rundeck OSS, Apache-2.0, core runbook automation and basic scheduling |
| **Mid-tier self-hosted** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | None published |
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | Enterprise Support: $1,000/month, all app features, SSO setup/support, air-gapped install support, private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat | PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, contact sales, commercial features, enterprise support, license key required |

PagerDuty's docs describe Runbook Automation Self-Hosted as commercial software that requires a license. They also state that a Runbook Automation subscription license is the only way to receive professional support from PagerDuty and the core Rundeck team. In contrast, xyOps paid plans are support subscriptions and do not unlock or restrict application features.

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | Rundeck |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, Libera Chat, PagerDuty community |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | None published |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Commercial Runbook Automation license includes enterprise support from PagerDuty and the core Rundeck team |
| **Published self-hosted price** | $200/month for Professional, $1,000/month for Enterprise | Contact sales |

Rundeck's commercial support is tied to the commercial Runbook Automation license. xyOps separates product features from support: users can run the complete app for free, then buy Professional or Enterprise support when they want private ticketing, response targets, live chat, SSO setup help, or air-gapped installation support.

### Operations Coverage

| Capability | xyOps | Rundeck |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Runbook automation** | Yes, through events, workflows, plugins, actions, tickets, and API calls | Yes, this is Rundeck's core strength |
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Workflow visualization is listed as a commercial feature |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | OSS includes basic ops scheduling; advanced scheduling, blackout calendars, forecast visualization, missed job fires, and job-independent scheduling are commercial |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Native node inventory and dispatch model; commercial Enterprise Runner adds remote execution hubs for private environments |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | Enterprise Runner is commercial, installs on Windows, Linux, or containers, requires Java 11/17, and connects outbound over port 443 |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Node health checks are commercial, but Rundeck is not a general server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with fire/clear actions, snapshots, tickets, job limiting, and job abort controls | Integrates with incident and event systems, especially in the PagerDuty ecosystem, but core Rundeck is not a monitoring and alerting platform |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Integrates with tools such as ServiceNow in commercial offerings, but does not provide the same built-in lightweight ticket system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Key/password encryption and key storage are included in OSS; external or advanced secret integrations depend on commercial context and plugins |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | Commercial Runbook Automation feature |
| **Access control** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | Rundeck has ACL policy support; GUI-based ACL builder and evaluator are commercial |
| **High availability** | Multi-conductor deployment and external storage options documented, with Enterprise support available | High availability clustering, auto takeover, and load-balanced workloads are commercial |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | Self-hosted deployments are available, but commercial feature and support access requires a Runbook Automation license |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **Rundeck** when the main problem is self-service runbook automation: centralizing operational scripts, delegating safe job execution, running commands across node inventories, and fitting into an existing PagerDuty-centered incident response workflow.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating the automation and the infrastructure together: scheduling jobs across servers, watching live server metrics, firing alerts, capturing snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation workflows from the same system without moving into a commercial feature tier.

### Key Takeaways

- Rundeck is a close comparison because both products are built for operations automation, scheduled jobs, and self-service execution.
- Rundeck OSS is a mature open-source runbook automation platform, but many production-scale features are commercial in PagerDuty Runbook Automation.
- xyOps includes all application features in the open-source version, including SSO, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, snapshots, secrets, roles, and fleet-aware scheduling.
- Rundeck has strong name recognition in runbook automation and a natural fit for teams already standardized on PagerDuty.
- xyOps has the advantage when teams want monitoring, alerting, snapshots, incident tickets, and automation in one self-hosted application without feature-gated product tiers.
- Rundeck Runbook Automation Self-Hosted pricing is listed as contact sales, while xyOps publishes support pricing at $200/month for Professional and $1,000/month for Enterprise.

## Inngest

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Inngest** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Inngest is an event-driven durable execution platform for application developers. It lets teams write TypeScript, Python, or Go functions in their own codebase, then use Inngest for durable steps, retries, scheduling, flow control, events, queues, and observability. This makes it a strong fit for background jobs, AI workflows, product workflows, and serverless-friendly application logic.

xyOps overlaps with Inngest around workflows, scheduling, retries, queues, events, logs, metrics, and self-hosting. The difference is product center of gravity. Inngest is a developer workflow engine for application code. xyOps is an operations platform for running jobs across infrastructure, watching servers, firing alerts, opening tickets, taking snapshots, and coordinating remediation.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Inngest |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Durable execution and event-driven workflow engine |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Source-available SSPL with Apache-2.0 future license notice |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Hosted usage plans and enterprise support/options |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Product engineering teams that want durable application workflows without managing queues and state |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This includes workflows, scheduling, SSO, users, roles, secrets, plugins, web hooks, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, buckets, APIs, and fleet-aware execution.

Inngest is self-hostable, and the source code for Inngest and all services is available on GitHub. The self-hosted server can run as a single binary, with SQLite by default and optional Postgres and Redis backing services. Inngest also provides Docker Compose and Helm-based deployment paths.

The public Inngest pricing page is primarily for the hosted platform, but it does show which capabilities are associated with paid and Enterprise plans:

- **SAML, RBAC, and audit trails:** Listed under Enterprise plan features.
- **Exportable observability:** Listed under Enterprise plan features.
- **Trace and log retention:** 24 hours on Hobby, 7 days on Pro, and 90 days on Enterprise.
- **Trace and log exports:** Listed as contact-sales/exportable observability functionality.
- **Advanced observability:** Listed as an add-on / advanced feature for integrations such as Datadog.
- **Dedicated Slack channel:** Listed under Enterprise plan features.
- **Higher scale:** Pro and Enterprise plans raise execution, concurrency, realtime connection, and user limits.
- **Custom executions and users:** Listed under Enterprise.
- **Enterprise support and service guarantees for self-hosting:** The self-hosting docs say direct support is not guaranteed for self-hosted instances, and to contact Inngest for enterprise options if dedicated support or service guarantees are required.

### Self-Hosted Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | Inngest |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free self-hosted** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source | Self-hosted Inngest source and binaries, community/GitHub issue path, direct support not guaranteed |
| **Mid-tier self-hosted** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | None published for self-hosting; hosted Pro starts at $99/month |
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | Enterprise Support: $1,000/month, all app features, SSO setup/support, air-gapped install support, private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat | Contact sales for dedicated self-hosted support or service guarantees |

This is a practical difference for self-hosted buyers. xyOps publishes support pricing and keeps the application feature set the same across free, Professional, and Enterprise usage. Inngest publishes hosted-platform pricing, while self-hosted support and service guarantees point to enterprise contact-sales conversations.

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | Inngest |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | Discord, GitHub issues, support center, docs |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | No published self-hosted support tier; hosted Pro starts at $99/month |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Contact sales for dedicated support, dedicated Slack channel, and self-hosted service guarantees |
| **Published self-hosted price** | $200/month for Professional, $1,000/month for Enterprise | None published |

Inngest's docs are direct about self-hosting support: the support team does not guarantee direct support for self-hosted instances, and users should file an issue unless they need enterprise support or service guarantees. xyOps offers a lower-cost Professional support path for production self-hosted users, plus an Enterprise tier for more intensive support.

### Operations Coverage

| Capability | xyOps | Inngest |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Durable workflows** | Yes, through visual workflows, jobs, actions, limits, and plugins | Yes, this is Inngest's core strength |
| **Programming model** | Jobs and plugins can run arbitrary scripts or programs across target servers | SDK-defined functions in TypeScript, Python, or Go |
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Not the primary authoring model; workflows are authored in code using function steps |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | Event triggers, cron triggers, delayed functions, sleeps, queues, and scheduled jobs |
| **Flow control** | Workflow controllers, limits, queues, concurrency, retries, target selection, and server job weights | Concurrency, prioritization, throttling, debouncing, rate limiting, batching, idempotency, retries, and sleeps |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Functions run on the user's application compute; Inngest orchestrates execution but is not centered on server-fleet targeting |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | No comparable host agent. Inngest functions run from the user's application compute, and Connect workers communicate with the Inngest server |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Function and event observability, but not a general server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with fire/clear actions, snapshots, tickets, job limiting, and job abort controls | Basic alerting on hosted plans and observability around function failures, but not infrastructure alerting |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Not a built-in incident ticketing system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Signing keys, event keys, SDK security patterns, and optional end-to-end encryption middleware |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | SAML is listed for Enterprise users |
| **Roles and permissions** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | RBAC is listed under Enterprise plan features |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | Self-hosting is available; dedicated self-hosted support and guarantees require enterprise discussion |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **Inngest** when the main problem is durable execution inside an application codebase: background jobs, serverless-friendly workflows, product event handling, multi-step AI workflows, retries, sleeps, and queue-like flow control written directly in TypeScript, Python, or Go.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating infrastructure and production workflows together: scheduling jobs across servers, selecting healthy targets, seeing live server metrics, firing alerts, attaching snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation jobs from the same system.

### Key Takeaways

- Inngest is a strong developer-first durable execution platform for application workflows, background jobs, event handling, and AI workflows.
- xyOps is a stronger fit when the workflow engine needs to live beside server monitoring, alerting, incident tickets, snapshots, and fleet-aware job execution.
- Inngest self-hosting is supported, but the docs say direct support is not guaranteed for self-hosted instances unless dedicated support or service guarantees are arranged through enterprise options.
- Inngest's public pricing starts at $99/month for hosted Pro, while self-hosted support pricing is not published.
- xyOps publishes self-hosted support pricing at $200/month for Professional and $1,000/month for Enterprise, and all app features are included in the free open-source version.
- The products do not line up exactly. Inngest is primarily a code-first durable execution engine. xyOps is workflow automation plus the surrounding ops control plane.

## Windmill

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Windmill** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Windmill is an open-source developer and operations automation platform for scripts, workflows, internal apps, triggers, workers, resources, and secrets. It is one of the closer comparisons to xyOps because it is self-hostable, code-friendly, workflow-oriented, and built for teams that need to run operational automation rather than only connect SaaS tools together.

The biggest difference is product scope. Windmill is excellent at turning scripts, flows, forms, internal tools, and event triggers into a shared automation platform. xyOps is an operations platform that includes workflow automation, but also includes server monitoring, alerting, snapshots, incident tickets, server groups, target selection, and remediation workflows in the same application.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Windmill |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Developer platform for scripts, workflows, apps, triggers, and automation |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | AGPLv3 / Apache-2.0 sources, plus proprietary Enterprise and Community Edition code |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Enterprise features, seats, compute units, and priority support |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Teams that want to run scripts, workflows, internal tools, and event automation from a developer-friendly platform |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This includes workflows, scheduling, SSO, users, roles, secrets, plugins, web hooks, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, buckets, APIs, and fleet-aware execution.

Windmill is notably self-host-friendly. Its self-host page says self-hosting is not a second-class option, and that the open-source edition has no phone-home and no license server. The free self-hosted tier includes unlimited executions, scripts, apps, flows, variables, resources, Postgres triggers, WebSocket triggers, MQTT triggers, deploy-from-GitHub, infrastructure-as-code support, CI tests on deploy, workspace dependencies, and workflows as code.

At the same time, Windmill has a substantial Enterprise Edition. The pricing table lists these as limits or Enterprise features for self-hosted deployments:

- **Workspaces:** Free self-hosted is limited to 3 workspaces; Enterprise is unlimited.
- **Users:** Free self-hosted is limited to 50 users; Enterprise is unlimited.
- **Groups and granular permissions:** Free self-hosted is limited to 4 groups; Enterprise is unlimited.

### Self-Hosted Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | Windmill |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free self-hosted** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source | Free and open-source self-hosted tier, unlimited executions, community support, feature limits listed above |
| **Mid-tier self-hosted** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | Enterprise self-hosted starts at $120/month, with seats and compute units priced separately |
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | Enterprise Support: $1,000/month, all app features, SSO setup/support, air-gapped install support, private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat | Enterprise self-hosted with Enterprise Edition features, commercial license, SLA, priority support, and dedicated Slack or Discord channel |

Windmill publishes self-hosted pricing. The pricing model is more complex than xyOps because Windmill charges for Enterprise features, seats, and compute units. xyOps pricing is simpler: all app features are free, and the paid plans are support subscriptions.

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | Windmill |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | Discord, GitHub Issues, Questions site, docs |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | Team and Pro support docs describe 24/7 priority support with a goal of 48 hour response |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Enterprise support docs describe 24/7 priority support, 3 hour response, automation engineer assistance, and dedicated Slack or Discord |
| **Published self-hosted price** | $200/month for Professional, $1,000/month for Enterprise | Self-hosted Enterprise starts at $120/month, with seats and compute units priced separately |

Windmill's paid support is tied to Enterprise/product subscriptions, and its Enterprise support response target is strong. xyOps offers a more traditional support-only model: Professional support is available at $200/month without changing the app feature set, and Enterprise support adds faster response, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support.

### Operations Coverage

| Capability | xyOps | Windmill |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Scripts and jobs** | Yes, through events, jobs, plugins, shells, APIs, and workflows | Yes, this is a core Windmill strength |
| **Programming model** | Plugins and jobs can run arbitrary scripts or programs across target servers | Scripts and flow steps in TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, Bash, SQL, and other supported runtimes |
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Yes, with a low-code flow editor and workflows as code |
| **Internal apps** | Ticket and operations UI is built in; custom app building is not the main product category | Yes, Windmill includes low-code and full-code app builders |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | Schedules, webhooks, email triggers, HTTP routes, WebSockets, Postgres triggers, MQTT triggers, and Enterprise event triggers |
| **Flow control** | Workflow controllers, limits, queues, concurrency, retries, target selection, and server job weights | Branches, loops, retries, error handlers, sleeps, approvals, concurrency limits, priorities, and flow restart features |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Workers and worker groups are central, but xyOps is more directly built around server inventory, health, and target selection |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | Normal workers are available in self-hosted deployments, but remote agent workers are Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise; agent workers can run on Linux, Windows, or macOS, and native Windows workers are Self-hosted Enterprise |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Observability for jobs, queues, logs, workers, and services, but not a general server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with fire/clear actions, snapshots, tickets, job limiting, and job abort controls | Critical alerts are Enterprise, focused on Windmill operations rather than broad infrastructure alerting |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Not a built-in incident ticketing system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Variables, resources, secrets, workspace secret encryption, and Enterprise external secret backends |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | Free self-hosted includes up to 10 SSO users; uncapped SSO, SAML, and SCIM are Enterprise |
| **Roles and permissions** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | Roles, folders, ACLs, groups, and granular permissions, with higher group limits and instance-level roles in Enterprise |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | Self-hosted deployment is supported; Enterprise self-hosting uses a license key and usage/subscription reporting |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **Windmill** when the main problem is giving developers and operations teams a shared platform for scripts, flows, triggers, internal apps, worker queues, resources, and secrets, especially when building internal tools is part of the goal.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating infrastructure and production workflows together: scheduling jobs across servers, selecting healthy targets, seeing live server metrics, firing alerts, attaching snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation jobs from the same system.

### Key Takeaways

- Windmill is one of the strongest self-hosted comparisons because it covers scripts, workflows, apps, triggers, workers, secrets, permissions, and developer-friendly automation.
- Windmill's free self-hosted tier is generous, but Enterprise adds many security, observability, deployment, performance, flow-control, trigger, worker, and app-builder features.
- xyOps includes all app features in the open-source version, including SSO, roles, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, plugins, web hooks, buckets, secrets, snapshots, and fleet-aware scheduling.
- Windmill has a strong advantage when the goal includes internal app building and developer-facing script/flow authoring across many languages.
- xyOps has the advantage when the automation platform must also be the monitoring, alerting, ticketing, snapshot, and remediation platform.
- Windmill publishes self-hosted Enterprise pricing starting at $120/month, with seats and compute units priced separately. xyOps publishes support pricing at $200/month for Professional and $1,000/month for Enterprise, and does not gate app features behind paid tiers.

| **Background jobs** | Yes, through events, jobs, plugins, actions, APIs, and workflows | Yes, this is Trigger.dev's core strength |
| **Programming model** | Plugins and jobs can run arbitrary scripts or programs across target servers | Tasks are written in application code using Trigger.dev SDKs and deployed as task bundles |
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Not the primary authoring model; tasks and workflows are authored in code |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | Scheduled tasks, delayed runs, waits, and code-triggered jobs |
| **Flow control** | Workflow controllers, limits, queues, concurrency, retries, target selection, and server job weights | Queues, concurrency, retries, delays, waits, idempotency keys, priorities, TTLs, batch triggering, and run cancellation |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Self-hosted webapp and workers can scale separately, but Trigger.dev is not centered on server inventory and health-based target selection |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | No lightweight host agent. Self-hosted Trigger.dev runs webapp, supervisor, and worker components in Docker or Kubernetes; Cloud-only features include auto-scaling and checkpoints |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Observability and monitoring for task runs, traces, dashboards, and logs, but not a general server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with fire/clear actions, snapshots, tickets, job limiting, and job abort controls | Alert destinations are part of hosted plans; self-hosted alerts have high hardcoded limits, but this is task/run alerting rather than infrastructure alerting |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Not a built-in incident ticketing system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Environment variables and deployment configuration patterns for tasks and workers |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | Listed as an Enterprise Cloud feature |
| **Roles and permissions** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | Role-based access control is listed as an Enterprise Cloud feature |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | Self-hosting is available, but users are responsible for security, uptime, scaling, and reliability |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **Trigger.dev** when the main problem is reliable background execution inside an application codebase: long-running AI tasks, product workflows, serverless jobs without timeouts, scheduled tasks, retries, queues, waits, and real-time frontend status updates.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating infrastructure and production workflows together: scheduling jobs across servers, selecting healthy targets, seeing live server metrics, firing alerts, attaching snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation jobs from the same system.

### Key Takeaways

- Trigger.dev is a strong open-source background jobs framework for developers, especially for long-running application tasks, AI agents, schedules, retries, queues, waits, and real-time task updates.
- Trigger.dev self-hosting is available under Apache-2.0, but Cloud-only features include warm starts, auto-scaling, checkpoints, and dedicated support.
- xyOps includes all app features in the open-source version, including SSO, roles, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, plugins, web hooks, buckets, secrets, snapshots, and fleet-aware scheduling.
- Trigger.dev is a stronger fit when the workflow belongs inside an application codebase and should be deployed with that code.
- xyOps has the advantage when the automation platform must also be the monitoring, alerting, ticketing, snapshot, and remediation platform.
- Trigger.dev hosted Pro starts at $50/month plus usage and add-ons, while self-hosted support pricing is not published. xyOps publishes support pricing at $200/month for Professional and $1,000/month for Enterprise, and does not gate app features behind paid tiers.

## Prefect

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Prefect** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Prefect is an Apache-2.0 Python workflow orchestration platform. It is built around Python functions decorated as flows and tasks, with state tracking, retries, schedules, deployments, work pools, workers, automations, logs, events, and a UI. It is especially strong for data engineering, ML workflows, Python automation, background tasks, and teams that want orchestration to stay close to Python code.

In July 2026, Prefect announced that it was acquiring Dagster Labs. Prefect says the two products will remain distinct: Dagster keeps its name and open-source license, while Prefect continues as the dynamic execution-oriented product. This comparison therefore evaluates Prefect itself, not the combined company's full product portfolio.

xyOps overlaps with Prefect around workflows, scheduling, events, retries, concurrency, workers, logs, metrics, APIs, and self-hosting. The difference is operational scope. Prefect is primarily a Python workflow orchestrator and data/platform automation control plane. xyOps is an operations platform that combines job and workflow automation with server monitoring, alerting, snapshots, incident tickets, server targeting, and remediation workflows.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Prefect |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Python workflow orchestration and data/platform automation |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Apache-2.0 open source, plus commercial Cloud and Customer Managed offerings |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Hosted plans, Enterprise features, and Customer Managed self-hosted option |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Python/data/platform teams that want code-first orchestration with managed or self-hosted control plane options |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This includes workflows, scheduling, SSO, users, roles, secrets, plugins, web hooks, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, buckets, APIs, and fleet-aware execution.

Prefect Open Source is self-hostable and Apache-2.0 licensed. Prefect's docs describe a self-hosted Prefect server backed by a database and UI. The server stores flow run and task run state, run history, logs, deployments, concurrency limits, storage blocks, variables, artifacts, work pool status, events, and automations. SQLite is the lightweight default database, and PostgreSQL is recommended for production, high availability, and multi-server deployments.

Prefect Cloud and self-hosted Prefect server share a common set of capabilities, but Prefect's docs say Cloud provides additional organizational features such as RBAC, audit logs, and SSO. The Prefect Cloud vs OSS page also identifies Cloud as the better fit for organizations needing enterprise security such as SSO, RBAC, and audit logs.

The public Prefect pricing page lists these as paid or Enterprise/Customer Managed features:

- **Users and workspaces:** Hobby is limited to 2 users and 1 workspace; Starter includes 3 users, Team covers 4-8 users, and Enterprise is custom.
- **Deployments:** Hobby includes 5 deployments, Starter includes 20, Team includes 100, and Enterprise is unlimited.
- **Custom work pools:** Listed in paid tiers for bringing your own compute and infrastructure control.
- **Webhooks:** Included beyond the Hobby tier.
- **Service accounts:** Listed in Team and higher.
- **Automations:** Hobby includes 5 automations, Team includes 50, and higher tiers increase limits.
- **SSO:** SAML/OIDC is listed for Enterprise and Customer Managed.
- **RBAC and ACLs:** Listed for Enterprise and Customer Managed.
- **Directory Sync / SCIM:** Listed for Enterprise and Customer Managed.
- **Audit log retention:** Hobby has none, Team has 24 hour audit log retention, and higher tiers expand governance features.
- **IP allowlisting and PrivateLink:** Listed for Enterprise and Customer Managed.
- **Run retention:** Hobby lists 7 days, with longer retention on paid tiers.
- **API rate limits:** Hobby lists 625 requests/min, Starter lists 1,250 requests/min, and Enterprise limits are custom.
- **Uptime SLA:** Not included in Hobby; higher tiers add SLA-backed service.
- **Support channel:** Hobby uses community support; paid plans add commercial support paths.
- **Customer Managed:** Self-hosted Prefect for maximum control and compliance, including on-premises or air-gapped deployments, complete data sovereignty and network isolation, compliance-ready deployment, and white-glove deployment experience.

### Self-Hosted Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | Prefect |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free self-hosted** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source | Prefect Open Source, Apache-2.0, self-hosted server and UI, community support |
| **Mid-tier self-hosted** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | None published for self-hosted Open Source; hosted Starter is $100/month and hosted Team is $100/user/month |
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | Enterprise Support: $1,000/month, all app features, SSO setup/support, air-gapped install support, private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat | Customer Managed, contact sales, self-hosted Prefect with Enterprise features, deployment assistance, compliance, and support |

Prefect publishes hosted Cloud pricing for Hobby, Starter, Team, and Enterprise, and lists Customer Managed as a custom-priced self-hosted option. xyOps publishes fixed support pricing and does not place application features behind paid tiers.

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | Prefect |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | Community support, GitHub, Slack/community resources, docs |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | Hosted paid plans include commercial support paths; no published self-hosted Open Source support tier |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Enterprise and Customer Managed are contact-sales offerings with governance, scale, support, and white-glove deployment options |
| **Published self-hosted price** | $200/month for Professional, $1,000/month for Enterprise | Contact sales for Customer Managed |

Prefect's open-source server is free to self-host, while commercial support and enterprise governance are primarily packaged through Prefect Cloud and Customer Managed. xyOps uses a support-only model for self-hosted users: Professional support at $200/month, and Enterprise support at $1,000/month with faster response, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support.

## Apache Airflow

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Apache Airflow** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Apache Airflow is a mature, code-first platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Workflows are defined as Python DAGs, and Airflow is especially strong for data pipelines that benefit from a large provider ecosystem, dependency-aware scheduling, retries, backfills, task logs, and multiple execution models.

xyOps overlaps with Airflow around scheduling, workflow orchestration, retries, secrets, APIs, plugins, logs, and self-hosting. The products start from different operating models, however. Airflow treats Python-defined DAGs and task execution as the center of the system. xyOps treats operations as the center, combining visual workflows with server inventory, monitoring, alerting, snapshots, tickets, incident response, and fleet-aware execution.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Apache Airflow |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Code-first batch workflow orchestration platform |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Not from the Apache Software Foundation; third-party managed services are available |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Apache-2.0 open source |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | No commercial tier from the Apache Software Foundation |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Data and platform teams that want Python DAGs, rich scheduling, backfills, and a broad provider ecosystem |

### Feature Model

Airflow's core platform is open source under the Apache License 2.0. It does not use an open-core feature matrix or sell an official commercial edition. Organizations that want a managed control plane, bundled support, or a vendor-specific enterprise layer can choose from third-party Airflow services, but those products have their own pricing and feature sets and are outside this direct self-hosted comparison.

Airflow is primarily a workflows-as-code product. DAG authors define tasks, dependencies, schedules, and runtime behavior in Python. The web UI is designed for monitoring and operating DAGs, including graph views, run and task inspection, logs, assets, manual triggers, and backfills. It is not a drag-and-drop workflow authoring canvas.

Airflow 3 also supports event-driven scheduling through assets and asset watchers. This broadens its triggering model, but the project still describes Airflow as a platform for batch workflows rather than continuously running, streaming, or general-purpose infrastructure monitoring.

### Authentication and Access Control

Airflow 3 uses pluggable authentication managers. The default SimpleAuthManager is intended for development and testing, so a production deployment should select and configure an appropriate authentication manager. The Flask AppBuilder provider supports OAuth, OpenID, LDAP, and remote-user authentication, with built-in and custom roles for access control. Other community auth managers are also available.

xyOps includes local users and roles, a direct OIDC plugin, trusted-header SSO patterns, and group-to-role mapping in the open-source application. There is no separate identity feature license.

### Operations and Self-Hosting

A production Airflow deployment commonly includes an API server, scheduler, DAG processor, metadata database, and an executor with any required workers. SQLite is intended for testing rather than production. Airflow supports local execution as well as distributed models such as Celery and Kubernetes executors, and operators can run Python, shell commands, or provider-specific work.

This architecture is powerful, but the operator owns the surrounding platform: database reliability, component scaling, DAG distribution, worker capacity, log storage, upgrades, and authentication configuration. Airflow supports DAG bundles, remote logging, StatsD and OpenTelemetry metrics, callbacks, and notifiers to help teams build that operational environment.

xyOps has a different topology. A central server owns workflows, schedules, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, and history, while lightweight agents provide inventory, metrics, logs, and remote job execution on managed servers. Airflow workers execute DAG tasks, but they are not server-monitoring agents and do not provide xyOps-style fleet inventory or point-in-time snapshots.

### Feature Comparison

| Capability | xyOps | Apache Airflow |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| **Visual workflow authoring** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | No; DAGs are authored in Python, while the UI visualizes and operates them |
| **Workflow replay and recovery** | Replay completed workflows, retry jobs, or suspend and resume from a selected node | Clear and rerun task instances, retry failures, trigger runs, and backfill historical intervals |
| **Job scheduling** | Manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, Magic Link, keyboard, startup, plugin, catch-up, range, blackout, delay, precision, and quiet options | Cron, timedelta, timetable, dataset/asset, event, and manual scheduling patterns |
| **Flow control** | Controllers, limits, queues, shared capacity pools, concurrency, retries, target selection, dynamic overrides, and server job weights | DAG dependencies, branching, retries, pools, queues, trigger rules, task mapping, sensors, and executor-level parallelism |
| **Remote execution** | Agent-based execution across selected servers, groups, and environments | Executors and workers run tasks locally, in queues, containers, or Kubernetes, depending on deployment |
| **Server inventory** | Native inventory from connected agents | No native infrastructure inventory |
| **Server metrics and logs** | Native agent metrics, log watching, charts, monitoring, and alerts | Task logs and Airflow component metrics; host monitoring requires separate tooling |
| **Alerting** | Native monitor alerts, workflow events, ticket integration, plugins, email, web hooks, and APIs | Callbacks and notifiers for task or DAG state; infrastructure alerting depends on external monitoring |
| **Point-in-time snapshots** | Yes | No equivalent server snapshot system |
| **Incident tickets** | Native tickets with workflow and alert integration | No native incident-ticket system |
| **SSO** | Direct OIDC plus trusted-header SSO and group-to-role mapping | Pluggable auth managers; Flask AppBuilder supports OAuth, OpenID, LDAP, and remote-user patterns |
| **RBAC** | Native users, roles, privileges, groups, and environments | Built-in and custom roles through the configured auth manager |
| **Secrets** | Native encrypted secrets with environment and role controls | Connections, variables, and pluggable secrets backends |
| **Extensibility** | Plugins, workflows, APIs, web hooks, shell commands, and Node.js job code | Python operators, hooks, sensors, providers, plugins, callbacks, REST APIs, and shell commands |
| **Air-gapped operation** | Yes | Yes, when dependencies and providers are supplied inside the environment |

### Support

Airflow support is community-driven through project documentation, GitHub, mailing lists, and community channels. Commercial support is available from third parties rather than as an Apache Software Foundation product.

xyOps is free to self-support. Its optional Professional plan is **$200/month** and adds private ticketing with a 24-hour target. Enterprise is **$1,000/month** and adds SSO and air-gapped installation support, private ticketing with a one-hour target, and live chat. The software itself does not change between plans.

### When Airflow Is the Better Fit

Airflow is likely the better fit when:

- Your workflows are data pipelines naturally expressed as Python DAGs.
- Backfills, task dependencies, provider integrations, and data-aware scheduling are central requirements.
- Your team is comfortable operating Airflow's database, scheduler, executors, workers, authentication, and log stack.
- You want an Apache-licensed project with a large data-orchestration community and no official commercial feature tier.

### When xyOps Is the Better Fit

xyOps is likely the better fit when:

- You want visual workflow authoring alongside code and shell execution.
- You need server inventory, live metrics, log monitoring, alerts, snapshots, and incident tickets in the same application.
- Work must target changing groups of servers, with fleet limits, shared capacity pools, and server-aware weighting.
- Operations staff need to build and run automation without making Python DAG development the primary interface.

### Key Takeaway

Apache Airflow is a strong open-source orchestrator for Python-defined batch and data workflows. xyOps is broader operationally: it joins workflow orchestration to server monitoring, alerting, snapshots, tickets, and incident response. The choice is less about which scheduler has more knobs and more about whether the center of gravity is **data pipeline code** or **day-to-day infrastructure operations**.

## Dagster

This comparison focuses on **self-hosted Dagster OSS** and **Dagster+** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Dagster is a code-first data orchestrator built around assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, partitions, lineage, observability, and testability. It is especially strong for data platforms whose teams want to model the data products they produce, understand upstream and downstream dependencies, run partitioned backfills, and keep orchestration definitions in Python.

xyOps overlaps with Dagster around scheduling, workflows, retries, concurrency, logs, alerts, secrets, APIs, and self-hosted execution. The products target different operational layers. Dagster centers on data assets and data-pipeline execution. xyOps centers on infrastructure operations, adding server inventory, live metrics, log monitoring, snapshots, tickets, incident response, and fleet-aware remote execution.

In July 2026, Prefect announced its acquisition of Dagster Labs. Dagster's announcement says Dagster remains a distinct product with the same brand, team, open-source license, Dagster+ service, and existing customer contracts. This comparison therefore treats Dagster as its own product while noting that it is now part of Prefect.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Dagster |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Code-first data orchestration and data-asset platform |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Yes, with Dagster OSS; Dagster+ also supports Hybrid deployments |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes, through Dagster+ Serverless; Hybrid keeps execution in customer infrastructure |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Apache-2.0 open-source core, with proprietary Dagster+ services and features |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | Dagster+ base plans plus usage, with feature and scale differences |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Data teams that want software-defined assets, lineage, partitions, tests, and Python orchestration |

### Feature Model

Dagster OSS is a self-managed Apache-2.0 project. It includes the Python programming model, asset and job orchestration, schedules, sensors, partitions, backfills, asset checks, a web UI, and APIs. A production deployment generally requires teams to operate Dagster's webserver, daemon, database, code locations, and run infrastructure.

Dagster+ is the commercial managed product. It adds a hosted control plane, deployment management, authentication and collaboration features, operational insights, alert integrations, audit and security features, branch deployments, and a richer organization-wide catalog. Serverless deployments run code on managed compute, while Hybrid deployments keep user code and execution in the customer's environment and connect them to the Dagster+ control plane.

### Pricing and Plan Differences

Dagster+'s current public pricing uses a base subscription plus usage:

- **Solo: $10/month plus usage.** One user, one code location, and one deployment.
- **Starter: $100/month plus usage.** Up to three users, five code locations, and one deployment, with additional collaboration and catalog features.
- **Pro: contact sales.** Adds larger organizations and deployments, SAML SSO, SCIM, audit logs, additional alert integrations, dedicated support, and an SLA.

The pricing page lists separate credit rates by plan and additional serverless compute charges. Actual cost therefore depends on run duration, orchestration activity, deployment model, and plan. Dagster OSS remains free to self-host and self-support.

xyOps uses a simpler model. Every app feature is available in the open-source release. Professional is **$200/month** for private ticketing with a 24-hour target. Enterprise is **$1,000/month** and adds SSO and air-gapped installation support, private ticketing with a one-hour target, and live chat. Neither plan unlocks product features.

### Operations and Self-Hosting

Dagster's UI shows assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, runs, logs, and dependency graphs. The daemon evaluates schedules and sensors and performs other background work. User code is loaded from code locations, and runs execute through infrastructure chosen and operated by the deploying team or supplied by Dagster+.

This gives data teams a strong view of asset lineage, materializations, partitions, checks, and pipeline health. It does not turn Dagster workers or Hybrid agents into infrastructure-monitoring agents. Host inventory, CPU and memory trends, watched server logs, alert-to-ticket workflows, and point-in-time server snapshots remain separate concerns.

xyOps agents are designed for those infrastructure concerns. They report inventory and live metrics, watch logs, execute jobs across selected servers, and feed the same central system used for schedules, alerts, snapshots, tickets, and workflows.

### Feature Comparison

| Capability | xyOps | Dagster |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Visual workflow authoring** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | No drag-and-drop authoring; Python definitions are visualized and operated in the UI |
| **Data assets and lineage** | Workflows can move and transform data, but xyOps is not an asset catalog | Core strength, with software-defined assets, dependency lineage, materializations, partitions, and catalog views |
| **Data quality checks** | General jobs, workflows, monitors, and alerts can validate systems and data | Native asset checks integrated with asset execution and observability |
| **Workflow recovery** | Replay completed workflows, retry jobs, or suspend and resume from a selected node | Retry runs or steps, re-execute selected subsets, and launch partition backfills |
| **Job scheduling** | Manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, Magic Link, keyboard, startup, plugin, catch-up, range, blackout, delay, precision, and quiet options | Schedules, sensors, asset automation, manual launches, and partitioned backfills |

### Support

Dagster OSS users rely on documentation, GitHub, Slack, and the community. Dagster+ customers use the support portal or email, with plan-dependent service. The public pricing page lists a dedicated support channel, premium support, and an SLA for Pro.

xyOps is also free to self-support, but its optional paid plans are purely support subscriptions. Teams do not need a paid tier to obtain SSO, RBAC, audit history, snapshots, alert integrations, or any other app feature.

### When Dagster Is the Better Fit

Dagster is likely the better fit when:

- Data assets, lineage, partitions, materializations, and asset checks are the core operating model.
- Your team prefers Python-defined orchestration with strong local development and testing workflows.
- Partitioned backfills and visibility into upstream and downstream data dependencies are central requirements.
- You want a managed data-orchestration control plane through Dagster+ or are prepared to operate Dagster OSS yourself.

### When xyOps Is the Better Fit

xyOps is likely the better fit when:

- The primary objects are servers, jobs, alerts, tickets, snapshots, and operational runbooks rather than data assets.
- You want a visual workflow builder that operations staff can use without defining everything in Python.
- You need live server inventory, metrics, watched logs, remediation workflows, and incident tracking in one application.
- You want direct OIDC, roles, audit history, and every other app feature in the free self-hosted release.

### Key Takeaway

Dagster is a focused data orchestrator with an excellent asset model, lineage, partitions, checks, and Python developer experience. xyOps is a broader infrastructure-operations platform with visual workflows, fleet-aware execution, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, and tickets. Dagster is the stronger choice when **data assets are the system of record**. xyOps is the stronger choice when **servers and operational incidents are the system of record**.

## Make

This comparison focuses on **Make** versus **self-hosted xyOps**. Research was last checked on **August 26, 2026**.

Make is a cloud-based visual automation platform for connecting apps, building scenarios, orchestrating business processes, and adding AI-driven automation across teams. It is especially strong for no-code and low-code SaaS automation, with a large integration catalog, a polished visual scenario builder, templates, app connections, routers, filters, and team collaboration features.

xyOps overlaps with Make around workflow automation, scheduling, web hooks, conditional logic, integrations, execution logs, and API-driven automation. The difference is deployment and operational scope. Make is a hosted SaaS automation platform. xyOps is a self-hosted operations platform that combines workflow automation with server monitoring, alerting, snapshots, incident tickets, server targeting, and remediation workflows.

### Positioning

| Area | xyOps | Make |
|------|-------|------|
| **Primary category** | Complete ops platform: scheduling, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, incident response | Cloud-based visual automation and integration platform |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | No |
| **Cloud hosting** | No | Yes |
| **License posture** | BSD-3-Clause open source, all app features included | Proprietary SaaS |
| **Paid plans** | Support-only subscriptions | SaaS plans based on credits, features, and Enterprise support |
| **Best fit** | Ops teams that want automation, server awareness, alerts, tickets, and runbooks in one place | Teams that want visual no-code/low-code automation across SaaS apps and business systems |

### Feature Model

The xyOps free tier includes all app features, and the paid Professional and Enterprise plans add support services, not additional product capability. This includes workflows, scheduling, SSO, users, roles, secrets, plugins, web hooks, monitoring, alerts, snapshots, tickets, buckets, APIs, and fleet-aware execution.

Make is a hosted SaaS product. Its pricing page lists plans based on monthly credits, with credits consumed by module actions in scenarios. Make's hosting row lists AWS in the EU and North America, and its cloud-vs-self-hosted article frames Make as the cloud-based approach to automation. Make also offers an Enterprise on-prem agent, but this is for securely accessing local networks and core business applications from Make. It is not a self-hosted Make deployment.

The public Make pricing page lists these plan limits and paid features:

- **Credits:** Free includes up to 1,000 credits/month. Paid plans scale by selected monthly credits.
- **Base paid pricing:** Core starts at $12/month, Pro at $21/month, and Teams at $38/month for 10,000 credits/month. Enterprise is custom pricing.
- **Scheduling interval:** Free has a 15 minute minimum interval; paid plans support scheduling down to 1 minute.
- **API access:** Core and higher include access to the Make API, with higher rate limits on higher plans.
- **Priority execution:** Pro and higher include priority scenario execution.
- **Custom variables:** Pro and higher include custom variables.
- **Full-text execution log search:** Pro and higher include full-text execution log search.
- **Teams and team roles:** Teams and Enterprise include team collaboration and role features.
- **Scenario templates:** Teams and Enterprise can create and share scenario templates.
- **Custom functions:** Enterprise includes custom functions support.
- **Enterprise app integrations:** Enterprise includes access to business-critical enterprise apps.
- **On-prem agent:** Enterprise includes an on-prem agent for securely accessing local networks from Make.
- **Analytics dashboards:** Enterprise includes analytics dashboards.
- **Audit logs:** Enterprise includes audit logs for user actions.
- **Company single sign-on:** Enterprise includes OAuth2 or SAML2-compatible SSO.
- **Domain claim:** Enterprise includes domain claim for enforcing secure SSO login.
- **Overage protection:** Enterprise includes credits overage protection.
- **Advanced security features:** Enterprise includes enhanced security controls.
- **24/7 Enterprise support:** Enterprise includes 24/7 top-priority assistance from senior specialists.
- **Value Engineering team:** Enterprise includes access to strategic guidance from Make's Value Engineering team.

### Paid Tiers

| Plan | xyOps | Make |
|------|-------|------|
| **Free** | All app features, community support, BSD-3-Clause open source, self-hosted | Free SaaS plan, up to 1,000 credits/month, visual workflow builder, 15 minute minimum interval |
| **Mid-tier** | Professional Support: $200/month, all app features, private ticketing, 24 hour turnaround | Core starts at $12/month, Pro at $21/month, Teams at $38/month for 10,000 credits/month |

### Support Comparison

| Support path | xyOps | Make |
|--------------|-------|------|
| **Community help** | GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues for bugs, Reddit, Discord, videos, docs | Make Community, Help Center, Academy, docs |
| **Paid non-enterprise support** | Professional plan includes private ticketing and a 24 hour turnaround | Pricing table lists customer support, technical support from Make's expert team, and high-priority guidance on higher plans |
| **Enterprise support** | Enterprise plan includes private ticketing, 1 hour turnaround, live chat, SSO setup/support, and air-gapped installation support | Enterprise includes 24/7 top-priority assistance from senior specialists and access to the Value Engineering team |
| **Published self-hosted price** | $200/month for Professional, $1,000/month for Enterprise | No self-hosted product |

Make's support is tied to its SaaS plan structure. xyOps support is tied to self-hosted deployments, and paid support does not change the application feature set.

### Operations Coverage

| Capability | xyOps | Make |
|------------|-------|------|
| **Visual workflows** | Yes, with trigger, event, job, action, limit, controller, and note nodes | Yes, this is Make's core strength |
| **App integrations** | Plugins, web hooks, APIs, shell jobs, HTTP requests, and custom code | 3,000+ pre-built apps, enterprise apps, custom apps, HTTP/API tooling, and AI apps |
| **Programming model** | Plugins and jobs can run arbitrary scripts or programs across target servers | Visual scenarios, modules, routers, filters, custom JavaScript/Python code app, and custom functions on Enterprise |
| **Job scheduling** | Native scheduler with manual, schedule, interval, single-shot, plugin, catch-up, blackout, precision, range, and delay options | Scheduled scenarios, instant/app triggers, webhooks, and 1 minute minimum interval on paid plans |
| **Flow control** | Workflow controllers, limits, queues, concurrency, retries, target selection, and server job weights | Routers, filters, sub-scenarios, scenario inputs/outputs, dynamic connections, and visual branching patterns |
| **Fleet-aware job execution** | Native server groups, target expressions, server selection algorithms, job weights, per-server concurrency, and worker satellites | Not centered on server inventory or fleet-aware target selection |
| **Remote agents / runners** | xySat is a zero-dependency remote job runner and metrics collector, installed with one command as a service on Linux, Windows, macOS, or Docker | No self-hosted runner. Enterprise includes an on-prem agent for connecting private networks to Make; installers are available for Windows Server and Linux/Mac environments and require Java |
| **Server monitoring** | Native monitors, time-series graphs, real-time view, custom monitor plugins, per-server and per-group metrics | Real-time scenario execution monitoring and analytics, but not a server monitoring platform |
| **Alerting** | Native alert definitions over live server data, with fire/clear actions, snapshots, tickets, job limiting, and job abort controls | Scenario errors, notifications, and monitoring patterns, but not broad infrastructure alerting |
| **Incident tickets** | Native ticket system tied to jobs, alerts, files, comments, due dates, and runnable events | Not a built-in incident ticketing system |
| **Snapshots** | Native point-in-time server/group snapshots for forensic context and alert actions | Not comparable as a native server snapshot system |
| **Secrets** | Encrypted at rest, assignment to events, categories, plugins, and web hooks, runtime delivery as env vars or templates | Managed app connections and credentials inside Make |
| **SSO** | Included in the open-source app, with a direct OIDC plugin plus trusted-header SSO patterns and group-to-role mapping | Enterprise feature |
| **Roles and permissions** | Included in the open-source app, with privileges, roles, category restrictions, and group restrictions | Teams and team roles on Teams/Enterprise, role-based access and governance features on Enterprise |
| **Air-gapped installs** | Supported by documentation, and Enterprise support includes air-gapped installation support | No self-hosted or air-gapped Make deployment; Enterprise on-prem agent can access private networks from the SaaS platform |

### Fair Use Cases

Choose **Make** when the main problem is cloud-based visual automation across SaaS apps and business systems, especially for teams that want a no-code/low-code builder, thousands of app integrations, quick template-driven workflows, and hosted infrastructure.

Choose **xyOps** when the main problem is operating infrastructure and production workflows together: scheduling jobs across servers, selecting healthy targets, seeing live server metrics, firing alerts, attaching snapshots, opening tickets, and running remediation jobs from the same system.

### Key Takeaways

- Make is a strong hosted visual automation platform with a large SaaS app catalog, friendly no-code/low-code builder, and Enterprise governance features.
- Make is not self-hosted. Its Enterprise on-prem agent connects Make to private networks, but the Make platform itself remains hosted.
- xyOps includes all app features in the open-source version, including SSO, roles, workflows, monitoring, alerting, tickets, plugins, web hooks, buckets, secrets, snapshots, and fleet-aware scheduling.
- Make is a stronger fit for business app automation, SaaS integrations, and no-code/low-code teams that want hosted infrastructure.
- xyOps has the advantage when the automation platform must be self-hosted and must also be the monitoring, alerting, ticketing, snapshot, and remediation platform.
- Make Core starts at $12/month for 10,000 credits/month, Pro at $21/month, Teams at $38/month, and Enterprise is custom pricing. xyOps publishes support pricing at $200/month for Professional and $1,000/month for Enterprise, and does not meter workflow executions.
